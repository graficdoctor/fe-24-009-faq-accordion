## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I'd just learned how to do an accordion using React and I wanted to see how much of it I could use in another, similar project. 

### Continued development

I bounced on certain issues I need to figure out:
- on hover effect on the title & how to make the title clickable
- add in A11y
- change background-color in icons/components from other libraries
